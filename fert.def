Fertilizer options file "fert.100" will contain these values:
feramt(1)       amount of N to be added (gN/m2) in scheduled month
            Range: 0.0 to 9999.0

feramt(2)       amount of P to be added (gP/m2) in scheduled month
            Range: 0.0 to 9999.0

feramt(3)       amount of S to be added (gS/m2) in scheduled month
            Range: 0.0 to 9999.0

aufert          key for automatic fertilization
                aufert = 0.0:   no automatic fertilization
                aufert < 1.0:   automatic fertilizer may be applied to remove
                                some nutrient stress without increasing
                                nutrient concentration above the minimum 
                                level; the value of aufert is the fraction of
                                potential C production (temperature and
                                moisture limited) which will be maintained
                aufert > 1.0:   automatic fertilizer may be applied to remove
                                nutrient stress and increase nutrient
                                concentrations above the minimum level; a
                                value of aufert between 1.0 and 2.0 determines
                                the extent to which nutrient concentration is
                                maintained between the minimum and maximum
                                levels
                aufert = 2.0:   automatic fertilizer may be applied to remove
                                nutrient stress and increase nutrient
                                concentrations to the maximum level
            Range: 0 to 2

ninhib          reduction factor on nitrification rates due to nitrification
                inhibitors added with fertilizer, 1.0 = no reduction
            Range: 0.0 to 1.0

ninhtm          number of weeks to simulate the effect of the nitrogen
                inhibitor from the fertilizer addition
            Range: ? to ?

frac_nh4        fraction of N fertilizer that is NH4+ (ammonium)
            Range: 0.0 to 1.0

frac_no3        fraction of N fertilizer that is NO3- (nitrate)
            Range: 0.0 to 1.0
