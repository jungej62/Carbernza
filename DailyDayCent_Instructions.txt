DailyDayCent is built from the monthly version of Century and for the most
part the *.100 parameter files used by DailyDayCent are identical to the ones
used by Century 4.5 and DayCent 4.5.  There are a few input parameters that
need to be scaled to work with the smaller time step used in DailyDayCent as
compared to monthly Century and additional variables required for the som2 and
fine root pools split.
    CROP.100   - some differences in this file, see notes below
    CULT.100
    FERT.100
    FIRE.100
    FIX.100    - some differences in this file, see notes below
    GRAZ.100
    HARV.100
    IRRI.100
    OMAD.100
    TREE.100   - some differences in this file, see notes below
    TREM.100
    <site>.100 - some differences in this file, see notes below
    *.sch (schedule files)

Additional input files used by DailyDayCent are:
    SOILS.IN    - a description of the soil layer structure
    SITEPAR.IN  - additional site information needed by DailyDayCent
    OUTFILES.IN - allows the user to select which ASCII (*.out) output files
                  when running a DailyDayCent simulation

DailyDayCent must be run using a daily weather data file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIX.100 scaled parameter modifications for DailyDayCent:

When modifying the FIX.100 file for use with DailyDayCent the following
settings are recommended:
    ADEP(1)   = 10.0
    ADEP(2)   = 20.0
    ADEP(3)   = 15.0
    ADEP(4)   = 15.0
    ADEP(5)   = 30.0
    ADEP(6)   = 30.0
    ADEP(7)   = 30.0
    ADEP(8)   = 30.0
    ADEP(9)   = 30.0
    ADEP(10)  = 30.0
    FWLOSS(1) = 1.0
    FWLOSS(2) = 1.0
    FWLOSS(3) = 1.0
    FWLOSS(4) Is not used when extra drivers are used.  The extra drivers are
              the solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind speed input
              parameters in the daily weather file.  If not using the extra
              drivers set this value to 0.8.
    ANEREF(3) = 1.0
    OMLECH(3) < 2.0
    MINLCH    to approximately 2.5
    VLOSSE    = 0.0
    VLOSSG    = 0.0
    IDEF      = 1.0

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<site>.100 scaled parameter modifications for DailyDayCent:
 
When modifying the <site>.100 file for use with DailyDayCent set the SWFLAG
and STORMF parameters to 0.0.
     SWFLAG = 0.0
     STORMF = 0.0

Also, if you are modifying a <site>.100 file that was used for running monthly
Century version 4.0 you will need to remove the following parameters from the
<site>.100 file:
     W1LIG
     W2LIG
     W3LIG
as they are not used by DailyDayCent.

The values of SAND, SILT, CLAY, BULKD, PH, AWILT, and AFIEL in the <site>.100
file are overridden by their companion values in the SOILS.IN input file.

NOTE:
DailyDayCent does use the weather statistics from the <site>.100 file.  The
monthly average precipitation values are used in the atmospheric nitrogen
deposition function.  The average minimum and maximum temperature values are
used to replace missing temperature values in a daily weather data file.
Prior to running a DailyDayCent simulation be sure to use the
DailyDayCent_file100 utility to create weather statisitics for your <site>.100
file based on your daily historical weather data file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Schedule file notes for running DailyDayCent:

When creating your schedule file for DailyDayCent keep in mind that it
operates using daily weather data and must be able to find and read your daily
weather data file.  The "F" weather option choice is the only valid weather
option for the initial block in a DailyDayCent schedule file.  The weather
filename of the daily weather data file must also appear in your schedule file
following the "F".  If you use a weather option value other than "F" for the
initial weather option in your schedule file the simulation will not run.
Subsequent blocks may use either the "F", to start reading from the start of a
daily weather file, or "C", to continue reading the current weather file,
weather options.

Column  1 - Minimum depth of soil layer (cm)
Column  2 - Maximum depth of soil layer (cm)
Column  3 - Bulk density of soil layer (g/cm3)
Column  4 - Field capacity of soil layer, volumetric
Column  5 - Wilting point of soil layer, volumetric
Column  6 - Evaporation coefficient for soil layer (currently not being used)
Column  7 - Fraction of roots in soil layer, these values must sum to 1.0
Column  8 - Fraction of sand in soil layer, 0.0 - 1.0
Column  9 - Fraction of clay in soil layer, 0.0 - 1.0
Column 10 - Organic matter in soil layer, fraction 0.0 - 1.0
Column 11 - Minimum volumetric soil water content below wilting point for soil
            layer, soil water content will not be allowed to drop below this
            value
Column 12 - Saturated hydraulic conductivity of soil layer in centimeters per
            second
Column 13 - pH of soil layer

NOTES:
Fraction of silt for soil layer is computed as follows:
     fraction silt = (1.0 - (fraction sand + fraction clay))

For the trace gas subroutines it is currently recommended to use the following
layering structure for the top 3 soil layers in your soils.in file:
     layer 1 - 0.0 cm to  2.0 cm
     layer 2 - 2.0 cm to  5.0 cm
     layer 3 - 5.0 cm to 10.0 cm

The depth structure in this file should match the ADEP values in the FIX.100
file in such a way that the boundaries for the soil layer depths can be
matched with the ADEP values.  For example, using the file above and ADEP
values of 10, 20, 15, 15, 30, 30, 30, 30, 30, and 30:
     layers 1, 2 and 3 match the first 10 centimeter ADEP value
     layers 4 and 5 match the second 20 centimeter ADEP value
     layer 6 matches the third 15 centimeter ADEP value
     layer 7 matches the fourth 15 centimeter ADEP value
     layers 8 and 9 match the first 30 centimeter ADEP value
     layers 10 and 11 match the second 30 centimeter ADEP value
     layer 12 matches the third 30 centimeter ADEP value

The value for NLAYER in the <site>.100 file should be set to match the number
of ADEP values that you are using when you match the layering to the soils.in
file.  For the example above NLAYER should be set to 7.

==============================================================================
Time representation in output files:

DailyDayCent ASCII output files are produced in addition to the monthly output
in the *.bin file.  Simulation time in the DailyDayCent output file is
represented as a decimal value with the value preceding the decimal point
representing the year of the simulation and the value after the decimal point
representing the month in the simulation using the following values:
     Jan - .00
     Feb - .08
     Mar - .17
     Apr - .25
     May - .33
     Jun - .42
     Jul - .50
     Aug - .58
     Sep - .67
     Oct - .75
     Nov - .83
     Dec - .92

The *.bin file that is produced when using DailyDayCent contains monthly
output values.  Simulation times for the monthly output from the *.bin file
are represented as a decimal value with the value preceding the decimal point
representing the year of the simulation and the value after the decimal point
representing the month in the simulation using the following values:
     Jan - .08
     Feb - .17
     Mar - .25
     Apr - .33
     May - .42
     Jun - .50
     Jul - .58
     Aug - .67
     Sep - .75
     Oct - .83
     Nov - .92
     Dec - 1.00
These month fractions are added to the year value so that, for example January
of year 1998 will output as time 1998.08 (1998 + .08) and December of year
1998 will output as time 1999.00 (1999 + 1.00).

Note that the monthly time values in the *.bin files are shifted by 1/12 from
the DailyDayCent ASCII *.out output files such that:

          *.out file                *.bin file

Optional input files for DailyDayCent.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
nscale.dat:

The optional multipliers on N inputs contained in this file can be used to
scale the amount of fertilizer added through FERT events, the amount of
atmospheric N deposition, or both.  This file is organized in 13 columns.
Column 1 is the year.  Columns 2 - 13 contain the N input scalars for each
month of the year with column 2 = scalar value for Jan, column 3 = scalar
value for Feb, ..., column 13 = scalar value for Dec.  A value of 1.0 used for
a scalar will have no effect on the amount of N input.  A value of less that
1.0 used for a scalar will reduce the N input amount.  A value of greater than
1.0 used for the scalar will increase the N input amount.  A value of less
than 0.0 in the nscale.dat file is invalid and the model will use the value of
0.0 for the scalar in this case, in effect eliminating the N inputs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
omadscale.dat:

The optional multiplier on OMAD inputs contained in this file can be used to
scale the amount of organic matter added through OMAD events.  This file is
organized in 13 columns.  Column 1 is the year.  Columns 2 - 13 contain the
OMAD scalars for each month of the year with column 2 = scalar value for Jan,
column 3 = scalar value for Feb, ..., column 13 = scalar value for Dec.  A
value of 1.0 used for a scalar will have no effect on the amount of organic
matter input.  A value of less that 1.0 used for a scalar will reduce the
organic matter input amount.  A value of greater than 1.0 used for the scalar
will increase the organic matter input amount.  A value of less than 0.0 in
the omadscale.dat file is invalid and the model will use a value of 0.0 for
the scalar in this case, in effect eliminating the OMAD inputs.

each month of the year with column 2 = scalar value for Jan, column 3 = scalar
value for Feb, ..., column 13 = scalar value for Dec.  A value of 1.0 used for
a scalar will have no effect on the soil pH.  A value of less that 1.0 used
for a scalar will reduce the soil pH.  A value of greater than 1.0 used for
the scalar will increase the soil pH.  All of the scalars are applied against
the pH value as read from the soils.in file.  A value of less than 0.0 in the
phscale.dat file is invalid and the model will use the value of 1.0 for the
scalar in this case, in effect eliminating any shift in pH.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
tmaxscale,dat, tminscale.dat, and precscale.dat:

We have added options to allow the user to use scalars on the weather file
inputs to simulate climate change scenarios.  The scalars are stored in the
tmaxscale.dat, tminscale.dat, and precscale.dat for modifying maximum
temperature, minimum temperature, and/or precipitation respectively.  The
temperature scalars are addends and the precipitation scalars are multipliers.
These files are organized in 13 columns.  Column 1 is the year.  Columns
2 - 13 contain the scalars for each month of the year with column 2 = scalar
value for Jan, column 3 = scalar value for Feb, ..., column 13 = scalar value
for Dec.

Temperature scalars of 0.0 will have no effect on the simulated temperature.
A value of greater than 1.0 used for the temperature scalar will increase the
temperature.  A value of less that 0.0 used for the temperature scalar will
decrease the temperature.

Precipitation scalars of 1.0 will have no effect on the simulated
precipitation amount.  A value of less that 1.0 used for a precipitation
scalar will reduce the precipitation amount.  A value of greater than 1.0 used
for the precipitation scalar will increase the precipitation amount.  A value
of less than 0.0 in the precscale.dat file is invalid and the model will use a
value of 1.0 for the scalar in this case, which will have no effect on the
precipitation inputs.

Code changes for DailyDayCent.

==============================================================================
Temperature curve change:

The temperature effect is now being computed using an arctangent curve,
previous versions of the model used an exponential curve.  The teff(4)
parameter values read from the FIX.100 file are used in the temperature
equation.
     TEFF(1) = "x" location of inflection point
     TEFF(2) = "y" location of inflection point
     TEFF(3) = step size (distance from the maximum point to the minimum
               point)
     TEFF(4) = slope of line at inflection point

The recommended default values for these parameters are:
     15.4000          'TEFF(1)'
     11.7500          'TEFF(2)'
     29.7000          'TEFF(3)'
     0.03100          'TEFF(4)'

==============================================================================
Options for computing the water effect on decomposition included:

DailyDayCent users have the option of using three different water curves to
calculate the water effect on decompostion depending on the parameter value
entered for the IDEF parameter in the FIX.100 file.

     IDEF = 1, use relative water content
     IDEF = 2, use ratio of precipitation to potential evapotranspiration
     IDEF = 3, use water filled pore space

==============================================================================
Non-symbiotic soil N fixation change:

Non-symbiotic soil N fixation is now being computed using annual 
evapotranspiration in place of precipitation.
     Old equation:
          non-symbiotic N fixation = epnfs(1) + 
                                     epnfs(2)*MIN(annual precipitation,100.0)
     New equation:
          non-symbiotic N fixation = epnfs(2) *
                                    (annual evapotranspiration - epnfs(1))

The recommended default values for the parameters used in this equation are:
     EPNFS(1) - 30.0000
     EPNFS(2) - 0.01000

==============================================================================
Phosphorus changes:

When running a simulation with phosphorus (NELEM >= 2) a back flow calculation
for flowing phosphorus from occluded P to secondary P has been added.  An
additional input parameter, PSECOC2, was added to the FIX.100 file to
parameterize the calculation for this flow.  The original PSECOC variable in
the FIX.100 file retains its original definition but has been renamed PSECOC1.

We have also implemented a check in the code to adjust the C/N ratio of leaves
when simulating phosphorus so that the N/P ratio of the leaves does not exceed
an observed critical value.  The new MAXNP parameter in the TREE.100 file
represents this critical value.

==============================================================================
Dynamic C allocation:

Grassland/crop system -

In the grassland/crop system the root to shoot carbon allocation is done as a
function of soil water and soil nutrient functions.  The new input parameters
in the CROP.100 file for controlling dynamic carbon allocation are:
     FRTCINDX    - plant growth type
                     0 - use Great Plains equation to compute root to shoot
                         ratio (fixed carbon allocation based on rainfall)
                     1 - perennial plant (i.e., grass, dynamic carbon
                         allocation)
                     2 - annual plant (i.e., crop, dynamic carbon allocation)
                     3 - perennial plant, growing degree day implementation,
                         dynamic carbon allocation

                     5 - grain filling annual plant, growing degree day
                         implementation, dynamic carbon allocation
                     6 - grain filling annual plant that requires a
                         vernalization period (i.e. winter wheat), growing
                         degree day implementation, dynamic carbon allocation
     FRTC(1)     - fraction of C allocated to roots at planting, with no water
                   or nutrient stress, used when FRTCINDX = 2, 4, 5, or 6
     FRTC(2)     - fraction of C allocated to roots at time FRTC(3), with no
                   water or nutrient stress, used when FRTCINDX = 2, 4, 5 or 6
     FRTC(3)     - time after planting (months with soil temperature greater
                   than RTDTMP) at which the FRTC(2) value is reached, used
                   when FRTCINDX = 2, 4, 5, or 6
     FRTC(4)     - maximum increase in the fraction of C going to the roots
                   due to water stress, used when FRTCINDX = 2, 4, 5, or 6
     FRTC(5)     - maximum increase in the fraction of C going to the roots
                   due to nutrient stress, used when FRTCINDX = 2, 4, 5 or 6
     CFRTCN(1)   - maximum fraction of C allocated to roots under maximum
                   nutrient stress, used when FRTCINDX = 1 or 3
     CFRTCN(2)   - minimum fraction of C allocated to roots with no nutrient
                   stress, used when FRTCINDX = 1 or 3
     CFRTCW(1)   - maximum fraction of C allocated to roots under maximum
                   water stress, used when FRTCINDX = 1 or 3
     CFRTCW(2)   - minimum fraction of C allocated to roots with no water
                   stress, used when FRTCINDX = 1 or 3

Tree system -

In the tree system carbon is allocated to fine roots and leaves first.  The
allocation to leaves is based on forest type and growing season.  For
deciduous trees growth occurs only between the months of leaf out and leaf
drop.  For deciduous and drought deciduous forests all of the C is allocated
to leaves during the leaf out period.  In tree growth periods that are not
identified as leaf out periods carbon is allocated to fine roots first then to
leaves, up to a optimum LAI based on large wood biomass.  Any leftover C to be
allocated after partitioning to fine roots and leaves is then distributed to
the woody components, fine branches, coarse roots, and large wood, based on a
normalizing of the carbon allocation fractions defined for the tree in the
TREE.100 file, FCFRAC(3,*), FCFRAC(4,*), and FCFRAC(5,*).  Potential tree
production is now controlled by the PRDX(2) (formerly PRDX(3)), maximum net
forest production, input parameter only, the original PRDX(2) parameter is no
longer being used and has been removed from the file.  The new input
parameters in the TREE.100 file for controlling dynamic carbon allocation are:
     TFRTCN(1)   - maximum fraction of C allocated to fine roots under maximum
                   nutrient stress
     TFRTCN(2)   - minimum fraction of C allocated to fine roots with no
                   nutrient stress
     TFRTCW(1)   - maximum fraction of C allocated to fine roots under maximum
                   water stress
     TFRTCW(2)   - minimum fraction of C allocated to fine roots with no water
                   stress

==============================================================================
Maintenance and growth respiration:

In addition to heterotrophic respiration from decomposition, RESP(1),
DailyDayCent includes submodels to simulate maintenance and growth
respiration.  A user defined portion of net primary production, NPP, is 
allocated to the carbohydrate storage pool.  This pool supplies C for
maintenance and growth respiration for above and belowground plant
compartments.  Respiration for each plant compartment is a function of the
mass of the compartment, soil or air temperature, and user defined maximum
respiration parameters.

The new input parameters for controlling maintenance and growth respiration in
the CROP.100 file are:

==============================================================================
Changes to the savanna submodel:

The SITPOT variable value will be dynamic and will be computed as a function
of average annual precipitation.  Average annual precipitation is calculated
by summing the PRECIP(*) values from the <site>.100 files.  For tuning
purposes the SITPOT parameter value read from the TREE.100 file for the
current tree will be used as a multiplier.
     if (arain .lt. 30.0) then
       sitpot = 1000.0
     else if (arain .gt. 80.0) then
       sitpot = 3500.0
     else
       sitpot = line(arain, 30.0, 1000.0, 80.0, 3500.0)
     endif
     sitpot = sitpot * sitpot_m
Where:
     arain    = average annual rainfall
     sitpot_m = sitpot value for current tree as read from TREE.100 file
And:
     The line function returns the following value:
          line = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) * (x - x2) + y2
          Where:
               x  = arain
               x1 = 30.0 
               y1 = 1000.0
               x2 = 80.0
               y1 = 3500.0
The recommendation is to set all of the SITPOT parameters in a converted
TREE.100 file to 1.0 for no multiplicative effect.

We have also modified the way that the tree basal area is being calculated.
Old code:
        wdbmas = (fbrchc + rlwodc) * 2.0
        trbasl = wdbmas / basfct
New code:
        wdbmas = (fbrchc + rlwodc) * 2.0
        basf = (wdbmas/(0.88 * ((wdbmas * 0.01)**0.635)))
        if (basf .lt. 250.0) then
          basf = basf * basfct
        endif
        trbasl = wdbmas / basf
Where:
     wdbmas = wood biomass
     fbrchc = fine branch carbon
     rlwodc = large wood carbon
     trbasl = tree basal area
     basfct = input parameter from TREE.100 file, the recommended default
              value for this input parameter is 1.0

==============================================================================
Fire code changes for charcoal:

There have been changes to fire code so that removal, by burning, of dead fine
branches and dead large wood will occur as the result of a FIRE event rather
than of a TREM event.  A TREM fire event will burn only live leaves, live fine
branches, and live large wood.  A TREM cutting, windstorm or other non-fire
event will allow the removal of dead fine branches and dead large wood in the
same manner as Century 4.0.  When burning dead fine branches and dead large
through a FIRE event the burned carbon in the dead wood can be returned to the
system as charcoal in the passive SOM pool.  (See the changes in the FIRE.100
input parameters for more information on how the charcoal return is 
parameterized.)

==============================================================================
Grazing change:

The GRET(1) parameter from the GRAZ.100 file is no longer being used.  The
value for GRET(1) now being used in the model equations is calculated based on
soil texture so that the fraction of consumed N that is returned is now a
function of clay content.
     if (clay .lt. 0.0) then
       gret(iel) = 0.7
     else if (clay .gt. 0.30) then
       gret(iel) = 0.85
     else
       gret(iel) = line(clay, 0.0, 0.7, 0.30, 0.85)
     endif

The line function returns the following value:
     line = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) * (x - x2) + y2
     Where:
       x  = clay
       x1 = 0.0
       y1 = 0.7
       x2 = 0.30
       y2 = 0.85

==============================================================================
pH effect on decomposition:

A pH effect multiplier has been added to the decomposition equations.  There
are three equations used to simulate bacterial, fungi, and combination pH
effects on decomposition flows as follows:
     SOM1C(1)  - combination
     SOM1C(2)  - bacterial
     SOM2C(1)  - combination
     SOM2C(2)  - combination
     SOM3C     - fungi
     METABC(1) - bacterial
     METABC(2) - bacterial
     STRUCC(1) - combination
     STRUCC(2) - combination
     WOOD1C    - combination
     WOOD2C    - combination
     WOOD3C    - combination

The user also has the ability to simulate a shift in soil pH content if
desired.  This is implemented with a change in the schedule file.  If the
value for PHSYS as read from the schedule file is greater than 0 then the next
line in the schedule file contains the start year for the pH shift to begin.
The optional multiplier on pH can be used to scale the amount of pH in the
soil, for example to simulate liming experiments.  The phscale.dat file
contains the pH scalars.  The file is organized in 13 columns.  Column 1 is
the year.  Columns 2 - 13 contain the pH scalars.  A value of 1.0 used for a
scalar will have no effect on the amount of pH.  A value of less that 1.0 used
for a scalar will reduce the pH.  A value of greater than 1.0 used for the
scalar will increase the pH.  All of the scalars are applied against the pH
value as read from the site file.  A value of less than 0.0 in the phscale.dat
file is invalid and the model will use the value of 1.0 for the scalar in this
case, in effect eliminating any shift in pH.  If the pH shift is not being
modeled a value of 0 should be read in for the PHSYS variable.

==============================================================================
Potential production calculation change:

Potential production is now taking into account the photo period effect on
growth.  In the fall, when the day length is decreasing, growth will slow
down.  The definitions for PRDX(1), CROP.100, and PRDX(2), TREE.100, have been
changed.  These parameters now represent the coefficient used when calculating
the potential production as a function of solar radiation outside of the
atmosphere.

Potential grass/crop production is now being computed in the same manner as
potential forest production using an estimate for total production rather than
estimating potential aboveground production only.  The allocation of
aboveground to belowground production for the grass/crop is now based on the
fraction of root carbon rather than the root to shoot ratio.

We recommend using a value of 0.5 for PRDX(1) and PRDX(2).

==============================================================================
Automatic fertilization:

Automatic fertilization was not working correctly in earlier versions of
Century.  Alister Metherell's modifications for the implementing the automatic
fertilization option were added to DailyDayCent.

==============================================================================
Irrigation change:

Irrigation will be allowed to occur even on days when the temperature is
below freezing.  This change was made to allow an irrigated system to reach
anerobic conditions even if the temperature is low.

==============================================================================
Implementation of a water table:

DailyDayCent can be parameterized to simulate a water table.  When simulating
a water table soil water in the deep storage will not drain out of the
profile.  This soil water will be permitted have an upward flow (evaporation)
in the soil profile.  To parameterize for a water table set the watertable
variable in the sitepar.in file to 1 for months in which a water table should
be maintained by the model.  It will also be necessary to set parameter
values for hpotdeep, hydraulic water potential of deep storage layer (for
maximum upward flow potential set this variable to 0.0), and ksatdeep,
saturated hydraulic conductivity of deep storage layer, in the sitepar.in
file.  DailyDayCent will not attempt to maintain a water balance when
simulating a water table.

==============================================================================
Changes in snow routines:

Previous versions of DayCent used hard coded parameter values for the snow
melt equation.  This has been changed so that the TMELT(*) parameters from the
fix.100 file are now being used in the snow melt equation.

The snow submodel has been modified so that order of events for snow has been
changed from accumulate, melt, sublimate to accumulate, sublimate, melt.

We have also added a solar radiation effect to the snow melt equation.  This
will require you to modify the value of TMELT(2) in your FIX.100 file from the
value used by earlier versions of the model.  We recommend using a default
value of 0.002 for this parameter.

==============================================================================
Runoff:

Since runoff calculations have been added to the model the storm flow is no
longer being calculated.  Runoff occurs when the water available for input
into the soil, from precipitation and/or snow melt, can not be infilitrated
into the soil due to impedence (from frozen soil layers) or the volume of
water is large enought that it cannot drain into the soil in the amount of
time alloted (hours_rain parameter in the sitepar.in file).  Due to this
change the STORMF variable in the <site>.100 file in no longer being used and
should be set to a value of 0.0.  The STREAM(1) output variable represents
baseflow + runoff.

==============================================================================
Dynamic value for NLAYPG:

The amount of soil water and mineral N, P, and S that is available for plant
growth is now based on a dynamic NLAYPG value.  Each crop and tree option will
have a specific NLAYPG value assigned to them in the CROP.100 (CLAYPG) and
TREE.100 (TLAYPG) files.  Any time a crop and/or tree option is changed the
value for NLAYPG will be recomputed.  In a grassland system the value for
NLAYPG will be based on the CLAYPG value read for the current crop option from
the CROP.100 file.  In a forest system the value for NLAYPG will be based on
the TLAYPG value read for the current tree option from the TREE.100 file.  In
a savanna system the value for NLAYPG will be weighted based on the crop/grass
LAI, tree LAI, and the CLAYPG and TLAYPG values.

The new NLAYPG value is also used for computing soil transpiration.  Soil
transpiration will occur from the top NLAPYG layers in the soil profile rather
than from the full soil profile.

The NLAYPG value from the <site>.100 file is no longer being used.

==============================================================================
User specified temperatures for leaf out and leaf drop in deciduous trees:

There have been two additional variables added to the TREE.100 file to allow
the user to specify the temperature values for controlling leaf out, TMPLFS,
and leaf drop, TMPLFF, for the specified tree.  These temperature values are
in degrees C.

==============================================================================
Change in PET calculation:

The PET calculation is now taking into account solar radition outside of the
atmosphere and an approximated cloud cover based on temperature range.  As a
result of this change the FWLOSS(4) parameter in the FIX.100 file needs to be
rescaled.  A default value of 0.8 is now recommended for this parameter.

==============================================================================
Fractional volume of rock used to modify field capacity and wilting point:

The ROCK parameter has been added to the <site>.100 file and will be used for
modifying the AFIEL(*) and AWILT(*) values when SWFLAG is not equal to 0.  Set
this parameter value to 0.0 to run a simulation with no rock effect on field
capacity and wilting point values.

==============================================================================
Daily scheduling:

The scheduling of events is now being done using year and day of the year
rather than year and month.

The calendar used for scheduling the events is for a non-leap year.

In the new daily scheduling scheme the following events will have effects
that will continue over a 1 month period (30 day):
     CULT - the multipliers for increased decomposition will be used for one
            month
     EROD - enter the per week amount of erosion, this erosion loss will
            continue over a one month period
     GRAZ - grazing events will continue for a month and restrictions on
            production due to grazing will be effect for one month
     IRRI - the amount of specified irrigation will be applied weekly over a 1
            month period, the amount of irrigation that will be applied during
            a given week will depend on the fraction of the month that the
            simulation week represents
     SENM - no growth will occur in the one month period that follows the
            scheduled senescence event

NOTE:  If more than one of these events is scheduled within a one month period
       the original unexpired event will be replaced by the new event and the
       new event's effects will linger as described above.

==============================================================================
Soil warming experiments can now be simulated:

The soil surface temperature warming option allows the user to simulate
experiments where the soil surface temperature is warmed without an increase
in the minimum and maximum air temperature values.  The soil surface warming
option is implemented in the same manner the CO2 effect and the pH shift
effect options.  If the value for stsys as read from the schedule file header
is greater than 0 then the next line in the schedule file header contains the
start year for the soil surface warming and the following line contains the
amount to warm the soil surface temperature in degrees C.

==============================================================================
Implementation of a growing degree day submodel:

If desired, plant growth can be set to occur using a growing degree day
submodel.  When using the growing degree day submodel the start and end of
plant growth will be triggered based on phenology (soil surface temperature,
air temperature, and thermal units).

The following parameters in the crop.100 file control the growing degree day
submodel implementation:
     FRTCINDX    - plant growth type
                        0 - use Great Plains equation to compute root to shoot
                            ratio (fixed carbon allocation based on rainfall)
                        1 - perennial plant (i.e., grass, dynamic carbon
                            allocation)
                        2 - annual plant (i.e., crop, dynamic carbon
                            allocation)
                        3 - perennial plant, growing degree day
                            implementation, dynamic carbon allocation
                        4 - non-grain filling annual plant, growing degree day
                            implementation, dynamic carbon allocation
                        5 - grain filling annual plant, growing degree day
                            implementation, dynamic carbon allocation
                        6 - grain filling annual plant that requires a
                            vernalization period (i.e. winter wheat), growing
                            degree day implementation, dynamic carbon
                            allocation
     DDEMERG     - number of growing degree days that need to accumulate after
                   the PLTM event in order for plant emergence to occur
     DDBASE      - number of degree days required to reach anthesis
                   (flowering)
     TMPKILL     - temperature at which growth will stop when using the
                   growing degree day submodel (degrees C)
     BASETEMP(1) - base temperature for crop growth, growing degree days will
                   accumulate only on days when the average temperature is
                   greater than the base temperature for the crop (degrees C)
     BASETEMP(2) - ceiling on the maximum temperature used to accumulate
                   growing degree days (degrees C)
     MNDDHRV     - minimum number of degree days from anthesis (flowering) to
                   plant maturity
     MXDDHRV     - maximum number of degree days from anthesis (flowering) to
                   plant maturity

==============================================================================
Added ability to simulate reduction factor on nitrification when fertilizing:

A new parameter, NINHIB, added to the FERT.100 file represents a reduction
factor on nitrification rates due to nitrification inhibitors added to the
site with the fertilizer.  This parameter value is used as a multiplier in the
calculation of the nitrification rate.  A value of 1.0 for this parameter will
have no effect on the nitrification rate.

Additionally the NINHTM paramter added to the FERT.100 file determines how
long, in number of simulation weeks, to simulate the effect of the nitrogen
inhibitor from the fertilizer addition.

==============================================================================
Added ability to simulate a lag in drainage of soil profile after a rain
event for sites with poorly drained soils:

A drainlag parameter was added to the sitepar.in file (see below) to allow the
user to set number of days between a rainfall, snowmelt, or irrigation event
and the drainage of soil profile.  Use a value of 0 for this parameter to
allow drainage of the soil profile to occur on the day that the rainfall,
snowmelt, or irrigation event occurs as in earlier versions of the
DailyDayCent model.  When entering a value of -1 for this parameter the number
of days between the rainfall, snowmelt, or irrigation event will be computed
based on the soil texture in the soils.in file.  The maximum number of days
between water addition and drainage of the soil is constrained to <= 5 to
prevent numerical instabilities in the water flux subroutine.

==============================================================================
Added ability to turn off the respiration restraint on denitrification:

The start day of the year and end day of the year added to the sitepar.in file
(see below) allow the user to turn off the respiration restraint on
denitrification during the days off the year the fall between the given days.

==============================================================================
The VOLPL and VOLPLA output variables now include the N that is volatilized
from excreted animal waste:

In the grazing subroutine we are now calculating the amount of N that is
volatilized from excreted faeces and urine.  This volatilized N is added to
the VOLPL and VOLPLA output variables.

==============================================================================
Separate decomposition rates used for surface and soil pools:

When using the relative water content option, IDEF = 1 in the FIX.100 file,
the model will compute separate values for surface and soil decomposition
rates.

The water content in the top soil layer will be used for computing
decomposition for the surface pools; METABC(1), STRUCC(1), SOM1C(1), WOOD1C,
and WOOD2C.

A weighted average of the water content in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th soil layers
will used for computing decomposition for the soil pools; METABC(2),
STRUCC(2), SOM1C(2), SOM2C, SOM3C, and WOOD3C.  In addition this soil
decomposition rate will be used in the growth and phosphorous weathering
calculations.

==============================================================================
Added an option to allow the use of scalars on the N inputs:

The optional multiplier on N inputs can be used to scale the amount of
fertilizer added through FERT events, the amount of atmospheric N deposition,
or both.  The optional N scalar option is implemented in the same manner as
the CO2 effect, the pH shift effect, and the soil surface warming options.
If the value for Nstart as read from the schedule file header is greater than
0 then the next line in the schedule file header contains the start year for
the use of the N input scalars.  Valid N input scalar options are as follows:
     0 - No scalars used
     1 - Use scalars on FERT options only
     2 - Use scalars on atmospheric N deposition only
     3 - Use scalars on both FERT options and atmospheric N deposition

The nscale.dat file contains the N input scalars.  The file is organized in 13
columns.  Column 1 is the year.  Columns 2 - 13 contain the N input scalars.
A value of 1.0 used for a scalar will have no effect on the amount of N input.
A value of less that 1.0 used for a scalar will reduce the N input amount.  A
value of greater than 1.0 used for the scalar will increase the N input
amount.  A value of less than 0.0 in the nscale.dat file is invalid and the
model will use the value of 0.0 for the scalar in this case, in effect
eliminating the N inputs.

==============================================================================
Added an option to allow the use of scalars on the OMAD inputs:

The optional multiplier on OMAD inputs can be used to scale the amount of
organic matter added through OMAD events.  The optional OMAD scalar option is
implemented in the same manner as the CO2 effect, the pH shift effect, and the
soil surface warming options.  If the value for OMADstart as read from the
schedule file header is greater than 0 then the next line in the schedule file
header contains the start year for the use of the OMAD scalars.  Valid OMAD
input scalar options are as follows:
     0 - No scalars used
     1 - Use scalars on OMAD options

The omadscale.dat file contains the OMAD scalars.  The file is organized in 13
columns.  Column 1 is the year.  Columns 2 - 13 contain the OMAD scalars.  A
value of 1.0 used for a scalar will have no effect on the amount of organic
matter input.  A value of less that 1.0 used for a scalar will reduce the
organic matter input amount.  A value of greater than 1.0 used for the scalar
will increase the organic matter input amount.  A value of less than 0.0 in
the omadscale.dat file is invalid and the model will use a value of 0.0 for
the scalar in this case, in effect eliminating the OMAD inputs.

==============================================================================
Changes made to decomposition subroutine:

When running simulations for the dry CPR site it was discovered that the soil
and surface litter decay was occurring too fast.  To address this problem
we changed the decomposition calculations to use relative water content as
relative water content is texture independent and the same curve can work for
multiple soil types.

==============================================================================
Fix for evaporation calculations:

When calculating evaporation if the top soil layer was too dry to allow
evaporation the water for the evaporation was being pulled from the bottom-
most layers in the soil profile.  Changes were made so that evaporation will
come from the second soil layer only when the top soil layer gets too dry.

==============================================================================
Add pulse multipliers to the computation for water effect on decomposition:

These multipliers work in the same manner as the pulse multipliers that are
used to increase of NO due to moisture and rain.  For the decomposition
calculations the pulse multiplier is used to enhance soil decomposition
following drying and re-wetting of the soil.

==============================================================================
Fraction of fertilzer that is NH4 and NO3 added to FERT.100 file:

Each fertilizer option in the FERT.100 file now has the fraction of NH4 and
NO3 in the fertilzer defined.  Two new parameters, FRAC_NH4 and FRAC_NH3,
represent the fraction of NH4 (ammonium) and fraction of NH3 (nitrate) in the
fertilzer respectively.  The fraction of N fertilizer that is ammonimum and
the fraction of N fertilizer that is nitrate values should sum to 1.0.

==============================================================================
Change in transpiration submodel:

We are no longer using the shallow, intermediate, deep, and very deep soil
depths to calculate a weighted average value to be used when calculating
transpiration.  The model is now using the wettest layer within the plant
rooting zone to calculate transpiration.  As a result the sitepar.in file
has been modified to remove the input that defines these layers.

==============================================================================
C14data:

Due to modifications to the way that labeled 14C is being simulated the value
read from the c14.dat file represents the concentration rather than the
percentage.

Additional output variables added to the *.bin file for tracking delta
13C/14C:
     DAUTORESP(1)  - delta 13/14C value for autotrophic respiration for
                     grass/crop system for stable isotope labeling

Dynamic value for CLAYPG for annual plants:

The value used as CLAYPG for annual plants will vary from 1 on the day that
plant growth starts to CLAYPG as read from the CROP option on day FRTC(3) of
plant growth.

The the FRTC(3) parameter in the CROP.100 file has had its definition changed
from months since planting to days since planting as follows:
     FRTC(3) - time after planting (days with soil temperature greater than
               RTDTMP) at which the FRTC(2) and CLAYPG values are reached

==============================================================================
Add ability to slow production late in the growing season for grass/crop and
decidious forest.

Variables added to the CROP.100 file:
     CURGDYS = number of days of unrestricted growth in a grass/crop system
     CLSGRES = grass/crop late season growth restriction factor

Variables added to the TREE.100 file:
     FURGDYS = number of days of unrestricted wood growth in a deciduous
               forest system
     FLSGRES = deciduous forest late season growth restriction factor

==============================================================================
Add calculation for the impact of surface litter carbon on mineral soil
surface temperature.

==============================================================================
The floating C/N ratios for new material being added to the surface organic
matter pools was using an older technique to calculate the ratios.  The code
has been updated so that the aboveground ratios are calculated in the same
manner as the belowground ratios.

Variables removed from the FIX.100 file:
     PCEMIC(*,*)

Variables added to the FIX.100 file:
     VARAT11(1,1) - maximum C/N ratio for material entering surface som1
     VARAT11(1,2) - maximum C/P ratio for material entering surface som1
     VARAT11(1,3) - maximum C/S ratio for material entering surface som1
     VARAT11(2,1) - minimum C/N ratio for material entering surface som1
     VARAT11(2,2) - minimum C/P ratio for material entering surface som1
     VARAT11(2,3) - minimum C/S ratio for material entering surface som1
     VARAT11(3,1) - amount of N present when minimum ratio applies
     VARAT11(3,2) - amount of P present when minimum ratio applies
     VARAT11(3,3) - amount of S present when minimum ratio applies

Renamed variables in the FIX.100 file:
     VARAT1(*,*) --> VARAT12(*,*)
     VARAT12(1,1) - maximum C/N ratio for material entering soil som1
     VARAT12(1,2) - maximum C/P ratio for material entering soil som1
     VARAT12(1,3) - maximum C/S ratio for material entering soil som1
     VARAT12(2,1) - minimum C/N ratio for material entering soil som1
     VARAT12(2,2) - minimum C/P ratio for material entering soil som1

     VARAT12(3,3) - amount of S present when minimum ratio applies

==============================================================================
Organic matter additions can now be added directly to surface som2 pool:

The user now has the option to add organic matter via OMAD events to the
surface litter or surface slow soil organic matter pools.  Previous versions
of the model added all OMAD into the surface litter pools.

Allowing for two types of organic matter addition.  Litter, for example wheat
straw, is added to the surface structural and metabolic pools by the partit
subroutine.  Partially decomposed organic matter, for example compost, can be
added directly into the surface slow pool (som2c(1)).

This model modification also requries a change to the omad.100 file (see
below).  An additional parameter, omadtyp, is added to the start of each OMAD
parameterization.  Valid values for this input parameter are:
     1 - organic matter added to the structural and metabolic pools
     2 - organic matter added to som2c pool

==============================================================================
Water stress effect on production now plant specific:

Added the WSCOEFF(1,1..2) parameters and WSCOEFF(2,1..2) parameters to the
crop.100 and tree.100 parameter files respectively.  With these coefficients
the water stress on plant production is now species specific.
     WSCOEFF(1..2,1) - relative water content required for 50% of maximum
                       production 
     WSCOEFF(1..2,2) - 4 times the slope at relative water content required for
                       50% of maximum production 

==============================================================================
The FAVAIL(1) input parameter has been moved from the fix.100 file to the
crop.100 and tree.100 (SFAVAIL(1..2) files so that it can become grass/crop
and/or tree species specific.

==============================================================================
Added two new parameters to the sitepar.in file to adjust the x-inflection
point for the water filled pore space effect on denitrification curve and to
allow the user to adjust the N2/N2O ratio.

==============================================================================
Replaced the single proportion of nitrified N that is lost as N2O parameter in
the sitepar.in file with two parameters that represent the maximum proportion
of nitrified N lost as N2O at field capacity and the minimum proportion of
nitrified N lost as N2O at wilting point.

NOTE:  The growing season accumulator values for carbon production (ACRCIS(*),
AFBCIS(*), AFRCIS(*), AGCACC, AGCISA(*), ALVCIS(*), ALWCIS(*), BGCACC,
BGCISA(*), CRTACC, FBRACC, FCACC, FRTACC, PTAGC, PTBGC, RLVACC, RLWACC) and
the growing season accumulator values for E uptake (EUPACC(*), EUPAGA(*),
EUPBGA(*), and EUPPRT(*,*)) output for the simulation were being reset to 0.0
at the start of the growing season, when a FRST, PLTM, or TFST event occurred.
These production output variables would seem to indicate that production was
still occurring because the output variables were not set back to zero at the
end of a growing season and would retain a constant value until the next FRST,
PLTM or TFST event occurred.  These accumulators are now being reset to 0.0 at
the end of the simulation timestep in which a LAST or TLST event occurs, after
the output for the timestep has been saved to the output file.
Old way:
     Accumulators initialized to 0.0 at start of run
     Accumulators reset to 0.0 on FRST, PLTM, or TFST and begin accumulation
New way:
     Accumulators initialized to 0.0 at start of run
     Accumulators begin accumulation on FRST, PLTM, or TFST
     Accumulators reset to 0.0 on LAST or TLST after output written to file

The new growing season production variables, AGCPRD, BGCPRD, CRTPRD,
EUPPRD(*), FBRPRD, FCPRD, FRTPRD, RLVPRD, and RLWPRD, are set equal to the
value of their associated accumulator value when a LAST or TLST occurs.  These
values can be used when examining yearly output to see the amount of
production that occurred over the previously completed growing season.  These
growing season production variables will be set back to zero in January if no
production has occurred over the previous 12 month period.

The new growing season accumulators for fertilizer addition (FERTAC, FERTMTH,
and FERTPRD), organic matter addition (OMADAC, OMACAE, OMADMTE, OMADMTH,
OMADPRD, and OMADPRD), and N2O flux (N2OACC, N2OMTH, and N2OPRD) are currently
being tracked for the grass/crop system only and will be reset on a LAST
event.

               water or nutrient stress, used when FRTCINDX = 2, 4, 5, or 6
     FRTC(3) - time after planting (days with soil temperature greater than
               RTDTMP) at which the FRTC(2) value is reached, used when
               FRTCINDX = 2, 4, 5, or 6

The FRTCINDX, FRTC(*), CFRTCN(*), and CFRTCW(*) parameters are used in the new
dynamic carbon allocation routines.  FRTCINDX is inserted into the crop
parameterization preceding the FRTC(1) parameter.  The FRTC(4), FRTC(5),
CFRTCN(1), CFRTCN(2), CFRTCW(1), and CFRTCW(2) parameters follow the FRTC(3)
parameter.

When converting from an existing Century/DayCent 4.0 CROP.100 file format to a
DailyDayCent CROP.100 file format the following rules will be used to set
default values for these parameters.
1.  If FRTC(1) = 0.0 in the Century/DayCent 4.0 crop parameterization assume
    this is a parameterization that should be set to use the Great Plains
    equation.
    Set FRTCINDX to 0.
2.  If FRTC(1) != to 0.0 in the Century 4.0 crop parameterization then we
    cannot make an assumption about what this parameterization represents.
    The user will be prompted to enter a 1 for a perennial plant, a 2 for an
    annual plant, a 3 for an annual grass using the growing degree day
    submodel, or a 4 for an annual crop using the growing degree day submodel
    to set the FRTCINDX value. 
In all cases FRTC(1) and FRTC(2) retain their original Century 4.0 values.
FRTC(3) needs to be adjusted from number of months to number of days by
multiplying this parameter value by 30.  FRTC(4) will be set to 0.2, FRTC(5)
will be set to 0.1, CFRTCN(1) will be set to 0.4, CFRTCN(2) will be set to
0.25, CFRTCW(1) will be set to the original Century 4.0 FRTC(1) value, and
CFRTCW(2) will be set to the original Century 4.0 FRTC(2) value.

The NO3PREF(1) parameter is not being used by the model currently but is
included for compatability with anticipated future code changes.  The
recommended default value for the NO3PREF(1) parameter is 0.25000.

The CKMRSPMX(1..3) and NO3PREF(1) parameters follow the CO2IRS(1) parameter.

The CLAYPG parameter is added to each crop option in the crop.100 file
following the NO3PREF(1) parameter.  It is given a default value of 4.

The DDEMERG, DDBASE, TMPKILL, BASETEMP, MNDDHRV, and MXDDHRV parameters are
added to the end of each crop option in the crop.100 file following the CLAYPG
parameter.  These parameters are given default values of 10.0, 1400.0, -2.0,
10.0, 100.0, and 200.0 respectively.

The definition for the PRDX(1) parameter has been changed and each crop option
in the crop.100 file should have the value for PRDX(1) set to a default value
of 0.5.  New DailyDayCent PRDX(1) definition:
     PRDX(1) - coefficient for calculating potential aboveground monthly
               production as a function of solar radiation outside the
               atmosphere

The definition of the FLIGNI(2,2) parameters had changed slightly:
     FLIGNI(1,2) - Intercept for equation to predict lignin content fraction
                   based on annual rainfall for juvenile fine root material.
     FLIGNI(2,2) - Slope for equation to predict lignin content fraction based
                   on annual rainfall for juvenile fine root material.  For
                   crops, set to 0

The RDR parameter has been renamed RDRJ and its definition has changed
slightly:
     RDRJ - Maximum juvenile fine root death rate at very dry soil conditions
            (fraction/month); for getting the monthly root death rate, this
            fraction is multimplied times a reduction fraction depending on
            the soil water status

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FERT.100:

New parameters in FERT.100 file used by DailyDayCent:
     NINHIB   - reduction factor on nitrification rates due to nitrification
                inhibitors added with the fertilizer
     NINHTM   - number of weeks to simulate the effect of the nitrogen
                inhibitor from the fertilizer addition
     FRAC_NH4 - the fraction of N fertilizer that is NH4+ (ammonium)
     FRAC_NO3 = the fraction of N fertilizer that is NO3- (nitrate)

Using a value of 1.0 for NINHIB parameter will have no effect on the
nitrification rate.

The default value for these parameters:
     NINHIB   - 1.00000
     NINHTM   - 7.00000
     FRAC_NH4 - 0.75000
     FRAC_NH3 - 0.25000

     FRET(3,4) - fraction of S in the burned dead large wood material returned
                 to the system following a fire event

The FDFREM(3), FDFREM(4), and FRET(1,1) parameters follow the FDFREM(2)
parameter.  The FRET(1,2) parameter replaces the FRET(1) parameter.  The
FRET(1,3) parameter replaces the FRET(2) parameter.  The FRET(1,4) parameter
replaces the FRET(3) parameter.  The remainder of the new FRET(*,*) parameters

The PSECOC parameter has been renamed PSECOC1 and retains its original
definition:
     PSECOC1 - controls the flow from secondary to occluded P

The PSECOC2 parameter follows the PSECOC1 parameter.

When converting an existing fix.100 file to work with the DailyDayCent
model the PSECOC1 parameter should retain the value for PSECOC and the
following default value is recommended for PSECOC2:
     PSECOC2 - 0.00000

DailyDayCent uses 4 coefficients in the equation for computing the
temperature effect on decomposition.  The TEFF(4) parameter is added to give
us the additional coefficient required to paramerterize the temperature
equation.  The definitions for the TEFF(*) parameters are as follows:
     TEFF(1) - "x" location of inflection point
     TEFF(2) - "y" location of inflection point
     TEFF(3) - step size (distance from the maximum point to the minimum
               point)
     TEFF(4) - slope of line at inflection point

The TEFF(4) parameter is inserted in the FIX.100 file following the TEFF(3)
parameter.

The following default values are recommended for the TEFF(*) parameters:
     TEFF(1) - 15.4000
     TEFF(2) - 11.7500
     TEFF(3) - 29.7000
     TEFF(4) - 0.03100

The PET calculation is now taking into account solar radiation outside of the
atmosphere and an approximated cloud cover based on temperature range.  As a
result of this change the FWLOSS(4) parameter in the FIX.100 file needs to be
rescaled.  A default value of 0.8 is now recommended for this parameter.

Due to the changes in the snow melting equation the following default values
will be entered for the TMELT(*) parameters:
     TMELT(1) - 0.00000
     TMELT(2) - 0.00200
TMELT(1) retains its original definition.  TMELT(2) has been redefined:
     TMELT(2) - coefficient used for calculating snow melt as a function of
                solar radiation outside the atmosphere

When modifying a monthly fix.100 file for use with DailyDayCent the
following settings are recommended when converting the file:
     ADEP(1)   = 10.0
     ADEP(2)   = 20.0
     ADEP(3)   = 15.0
     ADEP(4)   = 15.0
     ADEP(5)   = 30.0
     ADEP(6)   = 30.0
     ADEP(7)   = 30.0
     ADEP(8)   = 30.0
     ADEP(9)   = 30.0
     ADEP(10)  = 30.0
     ANEREF(3) = 1.0
     FWLOSS(1) = 1.0
     FWLOSS(2) = 1.0
     FWLOSS(3) = 1.0
     FWLOSS(4) = 0.8
     IDEF      = 1.0
     MINLCH    = 2.5
     OMLECH(3) = 1.9 (< 2.0)
     VLOSSE    = 0.0
     VLOSSG    = 0.0

The PCEMIC(*,*) parameters have been removed from this file.

The FAVAIL(1) parameter has been moved from this file to the crop.100 and
tree.100 files.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OMAD.100:

An additional parameter, omadtyp, is added to the start of each OMAD
parameterization.  Valid values for this input parameter are:
     1 - organic matter added to the surface structural and metabolic pools
     2 - organic matter added to surface som2c pool

                   determine the amount of carbon that is stored in the
                   carbohydrate storage pool for a forest system
     SFAVAIL(2)  - species specific fraction of N available to tree

The definitions of the WDLIG(2) and WOODDR(2) parameters had changed slightly:
     WDLIG(2)  - Lignin fraction for forest system juvenile live fine root
                 component
     WOODDR(2) - Monthly death rate fraction for juvenile live fine root
                 component

The TFRTCN(*) and TFRTCW(*) parameters are used in the new dynamic carbon
allocation routines.  TFRTCN(1) is inserted into the tree parameterization
following the FCFRAC(5,2) parameter followed by TFRTCN(2), TFRTCW(1), and
TFRTCW(2).  The TFRTCW(2) parameter and precedes the LEAFDR(1) parameter.

The recommended default values for TFRTCN(*) and TFRTCW(*) parameters are as
follows:
     TFRTCN(1) - 0.40000
     TFRTCN(2) - 0.25000
     TFRTCW(1) - 0.36000
     TFRTCW(2) - 0.30000

The recommended value for the MAXNP parameter is as follows:
     MAXNP       - 13.5000

The NO3PREF(2) parameter is not being used by the model currently but is
included for compatability with anticipated future code changes.  The
NO3PREF(2) parameter should be given a default value of 0.50000.

The MAXNP and FKMRSPMX(1..6) parameters follow the SITPOT parameter.

The SITPOT parameter is now dynamic and will be computed as a function of
average annual precipitation.  The SITPOT parameter value read from the
TREE.100 file is used as a multiplier for tuning this equation.  The
recommended default value of the SITPOT parameter is 1.0 so there will be no
multiplicative effect.

The definition for the PRDX(2) parameter has been changed and each tree option
in the tree.100 file should have the value for PRDX(2) set to a default value
of 0.5.  New DailyDayCent PRDX(2) definition:
     PRDX(2) - coefficient for calculating potential monthly forest
               production as a function of solar radiation outside the
               atmosphere

The PRDX(3) parameter is no longer being used and has been removed from the
tree.100 file.

The equation for computing tree basal area has been changed therefore BASFCT
is given a a default value of 1.0.

The TLAYPG parameter is added to the end of each tree option in the tree.100
file.  It is given a default value of 6.

The TMPLFF and TMPLFS temperature values are added to the end of each tree
option in the tree.100 file.  They are given default values of 7.0 and 10.0
respecitively.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<SITE>.100:

There have been 8 parameters added to this file.
     ROCK        - fraction of rock in soil (0.0 - 1.0)
     PRECRO      - the amount of monthly rainfall required in order for runoff
                   to occur (cm) (used by monthly Century only)
     FRACRO      - the fraction of the monthly rainfall, over PRECRO, which is
                   lost via runoff (0.0 - 1.0) (used by monthly Century only)
     SOM2CI(1,1) - initial value for unlabeled C in surface organic matter
                   with intermediate turnover
     SOM2CI(1,2) - initial value for labeled C in surface organic matter with
                   intermediate turnover
     RCES2(1,1)  - initial C/N ratio in surface organic matter with
                   intermediate turnover
     RCES2(1,2)  - initial C/S ratio in surface organic matter with
                   intermediate turnover
     RCES2(1,3)  - initial C/P ratio in surface organic matter with
                   intermediate turnover

The array size for the following parameters has been changed:
     SOM2CI(2,1) - initial value for unlabeled C in soil organic matter with
                   intermediate turnover
                   (replaces SOM2CI(1))
     SOM2CI(2,2) - initial value for labeled C in soil organic matter with
                   intermediate turnover
                   (replaces SOM2CI(2))
     RCES2(2,1)  - initial C/N ratio in soil organic matter with intermediate
                   turnover
                   (replaces RECES2(1))
     RCES2(2,2)  - initial C/P ratio in soil organic matter with intermediate
                   turnover
                   (replaces RECES2(2))
     RCES2(2,3)  - initial C/S ratio in soil organic matter with intermediate
                   turnover
                   (replaces RECES2(3))

The ROCK parameter is added following the CLAY parameter and is used to modify
AFIEL and AWILT values if SWFLAG is not equal to 0.  Set this parameter value
to 0.0 to run a simulation with no rock effect on field capacity and wilting
point values.

The PRECRO and FRACRO parameters are added following the STORMF parameter and
are used in place of hard coded values for computing the runoff amount in
monthly Century.

The following default values are recommended for these parameters:
     ROCK   - 0.00000 
     PRECRO - 8.00000
     FRACRO - 0.15000

The equation for computing the non-symbiotic soil N fixation has been changed.
This change requires a modification of the EPNFS(*) parameter values.  The
following are the default values used for the EPNFS(*) parameters:
     EPNFS(1) - 30.0000
     EPNFS(2) - 0.01000

When modifying a monthly <SITE>.100 file for use with DailyDayCent the
following settings are recommended and will be used here when converting the
file:
     STORMF = 0.0
     SWFLAG = 0.0

The WD?LIG parameters are obsolete and need to be removed from the <SITE>.100
file if necessary.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*.SCH (schedule file) changes:

The user now has the option of adding comment lines to the top of a schedule
file.  All of the comment lines must start with a # character and must be
stored at the top of the schedule file.  There is no blank line permitted
between the last comment line and the schedule file header line containing the
start year information.

Example DailyDayCent schedule file with no comment lines:
1             Starting year
2002          Last year
...

Example DailyDayCent schedule file with comment lines:
# comment line 1
# comment line 2
# comment line 3
1             Starting year
2002          Last year
...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The user also has the ability to simulate a shift in soil pH content if
desired.  If the value for PHSYS as read from the schedule file is greater
than 0 then the next line in the schedule file contains the start year for the
pH shift to begin.  The optional multiplier on pH can be used to scale the
amount of pH in the soil, for example to simulate liming experiments.  If the
pH shift is not being modeled a value of 0 should be read in for the PHSYS
variable.

Valid values for the pH scalar option are:
      0 - No scalar used
      1 - Use pH scalars

Example DailyDayCent schedule file header excerpt with no pH shift:
-1             CO2 Systems
0              pH shift

Example DailyDayCent schedule file header excerpt with pH shift:
-1             CO2 Systems
1              pH shift
1990

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have also added an option to simulate soil surface temperature warming
experiments where the soil surface temperature is warmed without an increase
in the minimum and maximum air temperature values if desired.  The soil
surface warming option is implemented in the same manner the CO2 effect and
the pH shift effect options.  If the value for stsys as read from the schedule
file header is greater than 0 then the next line in the schedule file header
contains the start year for the soil surface warming and the following line
contains the amount to warm the soil surface temperature in degrees C.

Valid values for the pH scalar option are:
      0 - No scalar used
      1 - Use pH scalars

Example DailyDayCent schedule file header excerpt with no temperature warming
experiment:
-1             CO2 Systems
0              pH shift
-1             Soil warming

Example DailyDayCent schedule file header excerpt with temperature warming

0.5

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have added options to allow the user to use a multiplier on the N
additions, FERT and/or atmospheric N deposition, and/or OMAD additions to the
simulation to scale these additions up and/or down as desired.  The
scalars are stored in the nscale.dat for FERT and/or atmospheric N deposition.
The OMAD scalars are stored in the omadscale.dat file.  These two files are
optional and if the scalars are not used you do not need to have these files
in your working directory.

Valid values for the N input scalar option are:
     0 - No scalar used
     1 - Use scalar on FERT options only
     2 - Use scalar on atmospheric N deposition only
     3 - Use scalar on both FERT options and atmospheric N deposition
If the value read from the schedule file header for the N input scalar is
greater than 0 then the next line in the schedule file header contains the
year to start reading and using the N scalar values for the nscale.dat file.

Valid values for the OMAD input scalar option are:
     0 - No scalar used
     1 - Use OMAD scalars

Example DailyDayCent schedule file header excerpt with no N input or OMAD
input scalars:
-1             CO2 Systems
0              pH shift
-1             Soil warming
0              N input scalar option
0              OMAD input scalar option

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We have added options to allow the user to use scalars on the weather inputs
to simulate climate change scenarios.  The scalars are stored in the 
tmaxscale.dat, tminscale.dat, and precscale.dat for modifying minimum
temperature, maximum temperature, and/or precipitation values respectively.
The temperature scalars are addends while the precipitation scalars are
multipliers.

Valid values for the weather input scalar option are:
     0 - No scalars used
     1 - Use scalars for minimum temperature only
     2 - Use scalars for maximum temperature only
     3 - Use scalars for both minimum and maximum temperatures
     4 - Use scalars for precipitation only
     5 - Use scalars for minimum and maximum temperatures and precipitation

Example DailyDayCent schedule file header excerpt with no climate scalars:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SITEPAR.IN:

As compared to DayCent version 4.0 the following parameters have been added to
the SITEPAR.IN file.

For parameterizing a water table simulation:
     drainlag       - number of days between rainfall event and drainage of
                      soil (-1=computed)
     watertable[12] - 0 = no water table, 1 = water table
     hpotdeep       - hydraulic water potential of deep storage layer
     ksatdeep       - saturated hydraulic conductivity of deep storage layer
                      (cm/sec)
These variables follow the hours_rain variable.

The texture input value read from the sitepar.in file is no longer being used.
The texture value used by the decomposition subroutine is computed based on
the weighted average of sand in the top 3 soil layers.

The texture input parameter has been replaced by the tbotmn and tbotmx
paramters.  The line containing these parameter values follows the fraction of
N fertilizer that is nitrate, frac_no3_fert, line.
     tbotmn - minimum temperature for bottom soil layer for year (degrees C)
     tbotmx - maximum temperature for bottom soil layer for year (degrees C)
Both parameter values are entered on the same line, separated by a space.

The dmp input parameter has been added to this file.  It follows the tbotmn
and tbotmx parameters.  This parameter is a time step, or damping, correction
factor that relates to how fast the heat gets into/out of the soil.
     dmp - damping factor for calculating soil temperature by layer

The timlag parameter has been added to this file.  This parameter represents
the time lag, in days, from the beginning of the year to the occurrence of the
coolest temperature at the bottom of the soil profile.  The timlag parameter
follows the damping factor for calculating soil temperature by layer 
parameter.
     timlag - time lag, in days, from the beginning of the year to the
              occurrence of the coolest temperature at the of the bottom soil
              profile

Add the Ncoeff parameter to this file.  This parameter represents the minimum
water/temperature limitation coefficient for nitrification.  This parameter
value is used to modify the value for the amount of NH4 that is converted to
NO3 due to nitrification.  It follows the timlag parameter.
     Ncoeff - minimum water/temperature limitation coefficient for
              nitrification

The start day and end day added to this file allow the user to turn off the
respiration restraint on denitrification during the days of the year the fall
between the given days.  These parameters follow the entries for the soil
layers comprising the very deep depths.

The fraction of N fertilizer that is ammonimum and the fraction of N
fertilizer that is nitrate values have been removed from this file and added
to the FERT.100 file.

Two nitrification N2O adjustment factor parameters have been added to this
file.  These factors are used as a multiplier on the nitrification rates.
     N2Oadjust_fc - maximum proportion of nitrified N lost as N2O at field
                    capacity
     N2Oadjust_wp - minimum proportion of nitrified N lost as N2O at wilting
                    point

We are no longer using the shallow, intermediate, deep, and very deep soil
depths to calculate a weighted average value to be used when calculating
transpiration.  As a result the sitepar.in file has been modified to remove
the input that defines these layers.

A new maximum daily nitrification amount coefficient has been added to this
file.  This value was previously hard coded as 0.4.
     MaxNitAmt - maximum daily nitrification amount (gN/m^2)

A new snow insulating flag has been added to this file.  This flag is used to
control the effect of snowpack on soil surface temperature calculation:
     1 = snow has an insulating effect
     0 = snow does not have an insulating effect.
In the past the model by default was coded to include the snow insulating
effect on soil surface temperature. 

Added coefficient to control the fraction of new net mineralization that goes
to NO3.  This value was previously hard coded as 0.0
     netmn_to_no3 - Fraction of new net mineralization that goes to NO3
                    (0.0-1.0)

Added multiplier for adjusting the x-inflection point for the water filled
pore space effect on denitrification curve

Added multiplier to allow the user to adjust the N2/N2O ratio.
